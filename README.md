# Mesa-framework
MESA (Modular Emergent Spatial Agent) is a powerful framework library in Python that I worked with on a small project. It provides a flexible and efficient platform for developing agent-based models, allowing us to simulate complex systems where multiple agents interact with each other and their environment.

In our project, we utilized the MESA framework to create a simulation of a field where robots and agents were responsible for changing the color of different areas and conducting analysis. By leveraging MESA's modular design, we were able to define the behavior and characteristics of each individual agent within the simulation.

The robots and agents within our system had the ability to move across the field, assess the current color of their surroundings, and make decisions based on certain rules or algorithms. For instance, they might change the color of a specific region based on a predefined condition or perform an analysis on the neighboring cells.
